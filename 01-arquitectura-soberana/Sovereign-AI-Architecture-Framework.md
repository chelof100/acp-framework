# Sovereign AI Architecture Framework
**Complete Framework v1.0**  
TraslaIA | February 23, 2026

## Optimal Structure (The Complete Framework)

### Level 1 – Strategic Framework  
**Sovereign AI Architecture**

- Defines institutional independence  
- Defines model and vendor substitutability  
- Defines true institutional control  

This is the **why**: the high-level strategic decision of any organization that wants to operate autonomous agents without losing sovereignty.

### Level 2 – Architectural Framework  
**GAT Model – Governance Architectural Model**

- Defines strict separation between decision and execution  
- Defines mandatory structural traceability  
- Defines governed multi-agent coordination  

This is the **what**: the reference architectural model that turns abstract governance into concrete design principles.

### Level 3 – Operational Protocol  
**ACP – Agent Control Protocol**

- Defines exactly how an action is validated  
- Defines message and token structure  
- Defines dynamic permission control  
- Defines structured auditability  
- Defines chained delegation limits  

This is the **how**: the technical language that makes GAT enforceable in production.

> **ACP is the technical language that implements GAT inside a Sovereign AI Architecture.**

## Why This Structure Matters

Most AI governance initiatives today jump straight to Level 3 (protocols or tools) without Level 1 or 2.  
The result is fragile, vendor-locked, and non-auditable automation.

The Sovereign AI Architecture enforces the correct sequence:

**Strategic Decision → Architectural Design → Operational Enforcement**

## How the Layers Map to Real-World Implementation

| Level | Name                        | Responsibility                          | Key Deliverables                          | Maturity Target |
|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1     | Sovereign AI Architecture   | Institutional strategy & sovereignty    | Board-level policy, substitution roadmap  | All organizations |
| 2     | GAT Model                   | System architecture & design principles | 6-layer agent model, maturity matrix, orchestration rules | Architecture teams |
| 3     | ACP Protocol                | Runtime enforcement & auditability      | Capability Tokens, Execution Tokens, Audit Ledger, Risk Engine | Engineering teams |

## The GAT Agent Layers (Level 2)

Every production agent is built with these six explicit layers:

1. Decision Layer (LLM / inference)  
2. Structural Validation Layer  
3. Policy Layer ← **implemented by ACP**  
4. Execution Layer  
5. State Layer  
6. Observability Layer

**Core Principle (P1):** Strict separation between Decision and Execution.

## GAT Maturity Matrix (Level 2)

| Level | Name                        | Key Capability                          | Typical Time   |
|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| 0     | Basic Automation            | Decision and execution coupled          | —              |
| 1     | Structural Validation       | Basic separation                        | 4–6 weeks      |
| 2     | Full Traceability           | Structured logs + ACP Ledger            | 8–12 weeks     |
| 3     | Dynamic Control             | Real-time permission management         | 12–16 weeks    |
| 4     | Multi-Agent Governance      | Orchestration + delegation limits       | 4–6 months     |
| 5     | Full Sovereignty            | Complete vendor/model decoupling        | 6–9 months     |

## Conclusion

The age of “just connect the LLM to your systems” is over.

Organizations now face a clear choice:

- Operate agents **with** a Sovereign AI Architecture (GAT + ACP)  
- Or operate them **without** it and accept the consequences.

**Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3** is not optional.  
It is the only path to governed, auditable, and future-proof autonomous systems.

**First the house. Then the neighborhood.**
